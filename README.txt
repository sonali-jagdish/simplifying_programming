Question 4

Consider a share market bazaar where the value of stocks keep going up and down. Write aprogram that asks for a company’s name and it’s share’s cost.

 The program should then usethese inputs and update the entry in the csv file which is in the following format

Company1,ShareValue1

Company2,ShareValue2

Company3,ShareValue3…

Eg:Google,123.45

Facebook,70.42

Apple,480.36

So when a user enters “Facebook,99.2”, the 
share value next to Facebook should be updated to99.2 and the csv file should then read as the following:

Google,123.45

Facebook,99.20

Apple,480.36

This application has a new requirement to show the status of the share value compared to the 
previous value. So if the new value is entered, and it is greater than the 
previous value, it should 
write “up”. If it lesser, it should write “down”, if it is the same, it should write “none”. 

 
Eg: 
Google,123.45,none
 
Facebook,70.42,none
 
Apple,480.36,none 
 

So when a user enters “Facebook,99.2”, the share value next to Facebook should be updated to 
99.2 and the csv file should then read as the following:
 
 
Google,123.45,none 

Facebook,99.20,up 

Apple,480.36,none

 



We are 3 in a team.We wanted to use the logic of the 2 codes which we've sent earlier(asn2_4.cand trying.c) out of which one ran into an infinite loop and the other
 just appended, but, we weren't able to implement it at all.So we have just hard coded the values of company's name and share value and also the modified value, indicated
 whether the market value has increased (up) or decreased (down) and printed it on the console.
This was not supposed to be what you had expected from us but we 
will make sure that the further assignments assigned will have results upto your expectations.
